This assignment will cover the material in Part 1 of the Django tutorial at 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/ but since we are doing the
installation on PythonAnywhere you will need to go back and forth between the Django
tutorial and our instructions to finish the assignment.

To receive a grade for this assignment, include this string 948221b0 on the pages
of your application.

Here is a sample of what you might put into your views.py.
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. 948221b0 is the polls index.")

Also you will need to edit the file mysite/mysite/settings.py and edit the
ALLOWED_HOSTS to look as follows:
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
