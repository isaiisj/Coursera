These exercises from our book Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach are an opportunity to study in further depth what you have learned from the lectures. 

1.2.30 Uniform random numbers. Write a program that prints five uniform random numbers between 0 and 1, their average value, and their minimum and maximum values.
Use Math.random(), Math.min(), and Math.max().

1.2.34 Three-sort. Write a program that takes three integer command-line arguments and prints them in ascending order.
Use Math.min() and Math.max().

For these two exercises, use only Java features that we have introduced in this course so far (e.g,. no loops or conditionals).
