<h1>Data structures</h1>
<p>In this module, you'll delve into fundamental data structures in Java, including Arrays, ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Stacks,
  and Queues. You'll start by understanding the basics of Arrays, focusing on their efficiency and limitations. 
  Then, you'll explore ArrayLists and LinkedLists to learn how these dynamic data structures offer flexibility in managing collections of data.
  You'll also cover Stacks and Queues, mastering their use in scenarios that require Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and
  First-In-First-Out (FIFO) operations, respectively. This module equips you with essential skills to effectively implement
  and utilize these data structures in real-world applications.</p>
