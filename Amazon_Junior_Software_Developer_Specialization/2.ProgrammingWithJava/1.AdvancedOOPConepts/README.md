<h1>Advanced OOP Concepts</h1>
<p>In this module, you'll explore advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, specifically interfaces and abstract classes in Java.
  You'll learn the importance of interfaces for code flexibility and how to implement them effectively, particularly in managing the challenges
  of multiple inheritance. Additionally, you'll understand the role of abstract classes in designing well-organized and 
  extensible class hierarchies.</p>
