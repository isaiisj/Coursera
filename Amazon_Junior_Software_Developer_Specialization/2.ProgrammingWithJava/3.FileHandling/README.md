<p>In this module, you will explore file handling operations in Java, covering topics such as reading from and writing to files,
  understanding different types of streams including byte streams and character streams, and performing file I/O operations such as reading,
  writing, and appending data to files. Additionally, you'll explore the concepts of serialization and deserialization, learning how to
  serialize objects to save their state and deserialize them to reconstruct their state.</p>
