<h1>Control flow: Statements and loops</h1>
<p>This module covers Java programming essentials, focusing on conditional statements, switch statements, and iterative structures. You will delve into the syntax and functionality of Java's "if", "else if", and "else" constructs, gaining a deep understanding of how these statements control program flow based on conditions. You'll also explore the benefits of switch statements over chained if statements. Furthermore, you'll master iterative structures such as for loops, while loops, and do while loops, understanding their advantages and when to apply them effectively.</p>
